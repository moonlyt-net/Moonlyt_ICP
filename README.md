## 💰 Tokenomics
### Revenue Redistribution Mechanism 💸
Revenues generated from the works are used to purchase MYLT tokens, which are then fairly distributed among NFT-holding investors and authors.

### Token Scarcity and Value Appreciation 📈
The total quantity of tokens is limited, ensuring their scarcity. As revenue increases, the value of the tokens has the potential to rise.

### Opportunities for Reinvestment and Sustained Interest 💵
This system offers attractive reinvestment opportunities for investors and fosters continued interest in the authors' creations.

### A New Model for Revenue Sharing 🤝
Directly benefiting creators and investors from the commercial success of the works, presenting a new model of revenue sharing in the webtoon industry.

### Promoting Sustainable Growth 🌱
Enhancing the creative drive of authors and offering valuable investment opportunities for investors, thereby fostering sustainable growth in the webtoon industry.
